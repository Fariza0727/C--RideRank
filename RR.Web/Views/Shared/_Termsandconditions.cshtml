            <dt class="heading-6">RR PLAYER RESERVE</dt>
            <dd>Customer deposits and player winnings after contests are finished are held in a separate, segregated bank account (the "Segregated Account") held by RR Player Reserve LLC, a legally separate and independent subsidiary of Rank Ride, Inc. Withdrawals which will be made from this Segregated Account, and checks issued from the Segregated Account, may bear the names of RR Player Reserve LLC.

            <dd>Rank Ride, Inc. will take appropriate steps to prevent unauthorized withdrawals from consumer accounts. Users are subject to an automated Knowledge Base Authentication ("KBA") verification process provided whenever a user attempts to withdraw funds.

In the event of a dispute as to the identity of a customer, Rank Ride, Inc. can and does require its users to produce a copy of their driver’s license, credit cards, utility bills or passport for identity verification. If a customer cannot validate their identity and account, Rank Ride, Inc. will not release the funds from the account. Once per month, Rank Ride, Inc. shall reconcile all liabilities owed to users and the sum of funds or credits in the Segregated Account, the PayPal Account, and credits due to Rank Ride, Inc. from credit card processors as of the end date of the immediately preceding month.</dd><br>
            <dd>Players who believe that funds held by or their accounts with Rank Ride Inc. have been misallocated, compromised or otherwise mishandled, may register a complaint with Rank Ride, Inc. online by e-mailing support@Rank Ride.com or in writing to 2760 Country Road 512, Stephenville, TX 76401. Rank Ride Inc. shall use its best efforts to respond to such complaints within ten (10) days.

If more information is required for Rank Ride Inc. to process the complaint, the response will note the form and nature of the necessary additional information needed.</dd><br>
            <dd>A player can request to withdraw funds from their account at any time. Requests for withdrawal will be honored by the later of five business days or ten business days of submission of any tax reporting paperwork required by law, unless Rank Ride, Inc. believes in good faith that the player engaged in either fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would put Rank Ride, Inc. in violation of Texas state law. A request for withdrawal will be considered honored if it is processed by Rank Ride, Inc. but delayed by a payment processor, credit card issuer, or by the custodian of a financial account. Players can also permanently close their account at any time for any reason through the Rank Ride, Inc. customer service department.</dd>

            <dd>In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.</dd>
